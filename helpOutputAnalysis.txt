 --scan_list [SCAN_LIST ...]
                        This option offers to run the analysis on a subset of the scans. The scans are selected by
                        providing the full path to the corresponding EPI file in the input BIDS folder. The list 
                        of scan can be specified manually as a list of file name '--scan_list scan1.nii.gz 
                        scan2.nii.gz ...' or the files can be imbedded into a .txt file with one filename per row.
                        By default, 'all' will use all the scans previously processed.
                        (default: ['all'])
                        
  --prior_maps PRIOR_MAPS
                        Provide a 4D nifti image with a series of spatial priors representing common sources of
                        signal (e.g. ICA components from a group-ICA run). This 4D prior map file will be used for 
                        Dual regression, Dual ICA and --data_diagnosis. The RABIES default corresponds to a MELODIC 
                        run on a combined group of anesthetized-ventilated and awake mice. Confound correction 
                        consisted of highpass at 0.01 Hz, FD censoring at 0.03mm, DVARS censoring, and 
                        mot_6,WM_signal,CSF_signal as regressors.

  --prior_bold_idx [PRIOR_BOLD_IDX ...]
                        Specify the indices for the priors corresponding to BOLD sources from --prior_maps. These will
                        be fitted during Dual ICA and provide the BOLD components during --data_diagnosis.
                        (default: [5, 12, 19])
                        
  --prior_confound_idx [PRIOR_CONFOUND_IDX ...]
                        Specify the indices for the confound components from --prior_maps. This is pertinent for the
                        --data_diagnosis outputs.
                        (default: [0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29])
                        
  --data_diagnosis      This option carries out the spatiotemporal diagnosis as described in Desrosiers-Gregoire et al. 
                        The diagnosis generates key temporal and spatial features both at the scan level and the group
                        level, allowing the identification of sources of confounds and data quality issues. We recommend 
                        using this data diagnosis workflow, more detailed in the publication, to improve the control for 
                        data quality issues and prevent the corruptions of analysis outputs.
                        (default: False)
                        
  --outlier_threshold OUTLIER_THRESHOLD

                        --data_diagnosis. The default of 3.5 is recommended in https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35h.htm. 
                        (default: 3.5)
                        
  --seed_list [SEED_LIST ...]
                        Can provide a list of Nifti files providing a mask for an anatomical seed, which will be used
                        to evaluate seed-based connectivity maps using on Pearson's r. Each seed must consist of 
                        a binary mask representing the ROI in commonspace.
                        (default: [])
                        
  --seed_prior_list [SEED_PRIOR_LIST ...]
                        For analysis QC of seed-based FC during --data_diagnosis, prior network maps are required for 
                        each seed provided in --seed_list. Provide the list of prior files in matching order of the 
                        --seed_list arguments to match corresponding seed maps.
                        (default: [])

  --ROI_type {parcellated,voxelwise}
                        Define ROIs for --FC_matrix between 'parcellated' from the provided atlas during preprocessing,
                        or 'voxelwise' to derive the correlations between every voxel.(default: parcellated)
                        
  --ROI_csv ROI_CSV     A CSV file with the ROI names matching the ROI index numbers in the atlas labels Nifti file. 
                        A copy of this file is provided along the FC matrix generated for each subject.

                        Note that confound correction must have been conducted on commonspace outputs.
                        * apply: compute group-ICA.
                        *** Specify 'true' or 'false'. 
                        * dim: Specify a pre-determined number of MELODIC components to derive. '0' will use an automatic 
                         estimator. 
                        * random_seed: For reproducibility, this option sets a fixed random seed for MELODIC. 
                        (default: apply=false,dim=0,random_seed=1)
                        
  --DR_ICA              Conduct dual regression on each subject timeseries, using the priors from --prior_maps. The
                        linear coefficients from both the first and second regressions will be provided as outputs.

                        subject-specific sources will be computed to account for non-prior confounds. This options 
                        specifies the number of temporal components to compute. After computing 
                        these sources, NPR will provide a fit for each prior in --prior_maps indexed by --prior_bold_idx.
                        Specify at least 0 extra sources to run NPR.
                        (default: -1)
                        
  --NPR_spatial_comp NPR_SPATIAL_COMP
                        Same as --NPR_temporal_comp, but specify how many spatial components to compute (which are 
                        additioned to the temporal components).
