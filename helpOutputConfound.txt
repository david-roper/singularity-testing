  --nativespace_analysis
                        Conduct confound correction and analysis in native space.
                        (default: False)
                        
  --image_scaling {None,background_noise,global_variance,voxelwise_standardization,grand_mean_scaling,voxelwise_mean}
                        Select an option for scaling the image variance to match the intensity profile of 
                        different scans and avoid biases in data variance and amplitude estimation during analysis.
                        The variance explained from confound regression is also scaled accordingly for later use with 
                        --data_diagnosis. 
                        *** None: No scaling is applied, only detrending.
                        *** background_noise: a mask is derived to map background noise, and scale the image 
                           intensity relative to the noise standard deviation. 
                        *** global_variance: After applying confound correction, the cleaned timeseries are scaled 
                           according to the total standard deviation of all voxels, to scale total variance to 1. 
                        *** voxelwise_standardization: After applying confound correction, each voxel is separately 
                           scaled to unit variance (z-scoring). 
                        *** grand_mean_scaling: Timeseries are divided by the mean signal across voxel, and 
                           multiplied by 100 to obtain percent BOLD fluctuations. 
                        *** voxelwise_mean: each voxel is seperataly scaled according to its mean intensity, 
                           a method suggested with AFNI https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/community/board/read.php?1,161862,161864. 
                           Timeseries are then multiplied by 100 to obtain percent BOLD fluctuations. 
                        (default: global_variance)
                        
  --detrending_order {linear,quadratic}
                        Select between linear or quadratic (second-order) detrending of voxel timeseries.
                        (default: linear)
                        
  --conf_list [{WM_signal,CSF_signal,vascular_signal,global_signal,aCompCor,mot_6,mot_24,mean_FD} ...]
                        Select list of nuisance regressors that will be applied on voxel timeseries, i.e., confound
                        regression.
                        *** WM/CSF/vascular/global_signal: correspond to mean signal from WM/CSF/vascular/brain 
                           masks.
                        *** mot_6: 6 rigid head motion correction parameters.
                        *** mot_24: mot_6 + their temporal derivative, then all 12 parameters squared, as in 
                           Friston et al. (1996, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine).
                        *** aCompCor: method from Muschelli et al. (2014, Neuroimage), where component timeseries
                           are obtained using PCA, conducted on the combined WM and CSF masks voxel timeseries. 
                           Components adding up to 50 percent of the variance are included.
                        *** mean_FD: the mean framewise displacement timecourse.
                        (default: [])
                        
  --frame_censoring FRAME_CENSORING
                        Censor frames that are highly corrupted (i.e. 'scrubbing'). 
                        * FD_censoring: Apply frame censoring based on a framewise displacement threshold. The frames 
                         that exceed the given threshold, together with 1 back and 2 forward frames will be masked 
                         out, as in Power et al. (2012, Neuroimage).
                        *** Specify 'true' or 'false'. 
                        * FD_threshold: the FD threshold in mm. 
                        * DVARS_censoring: Will remove timepoints that present outlier values on the DVARS metric 
                         (temporal derivative of global signal). This method will censor timepoints until the 
                         distribution of DVARS values across time does not contain outliers values above or below 2.5 
                         standard deviations.
                        *** Specify 'true' or 'false'. 
                        * minimum_timepoint: Can set a minimum number of timepoints remaining after frame censoring. 
                         If the threshold is not met, an empty file is generated and the scan is not considered in 
                         further steps. 
                        (default: FD_censoring=false,FD_threshold=0.05,DVARS_censoring=false,minimum_timepoint=3)
                        
  --TR TR               Specify repetition time (TR) in seconds. (e.g. --TR 1.2)
                        (default: auto)
                        
  --highpass HIGHPASS   Specify highpass filter frequency.
                        (default: None)
                        
  --lowpass LOWPASS     Specify lowpass filter frequency.
                        (default: None)
                        
  --edge_cutoff EDGE_CUTOFF
                        Specify the number of seconds to cut at beginning and end of acquisition if applying a
                        frequency filter. Frequency filters generate edge effects at begining and end of the
                        timeseries. We recommend to cut those timepoints (around 30sec at both end for 0.01Hz 
                        highpass.).
                        (default: 0)
                        
  --smoothing_filter SMOOTHING_FILTER
                        Specify filter size in mm for spatial smoothing. Will apply nilearn's function 
                        https://nilearn.github.io/modules/generated/nilearn.image.smooth_img.html
                        (default: None)
                        
  --match_number_timepoints
                        With this option, only a subset of the timepoints are kept post-censoring to match the 
                        --minimum_timepoint number for all scans. This can be conducted to avoid inconsistent 
                        temporal degrees of freedom (tDOF) between scans during downstream analysis. We recommend 
                        selecting this option if a significant confounding effect of tDOF is detected during --data_diagnosis.
                        The extra timepoints removed are randomly selected among the set available post-censoring.
                        (default: False)
                        
  --ica_aroma ICA_AROMA
                        Apply ICA-AROMA denoising (Pruim et al. 2015). The original classifier was modified to incorporate 
                        rodent-adapted masks and classification hyperparameters.
                        * apply: apply the denoising.
                        *** Specify 'true' or 'false'. 
                        * dim: Specify a pre-determined number of MELODIC components to derive. '0' will use an automatic 
                         estimator. 
                        * random_seed: For reproducibility, this option sets a fixed random seed for MELODIC. 
                        (default: apply=false,dim=0,random_seed=1)
                        
  --read_datasink       
                        Choose this option to read preprocessing outputs from datasinks instead of the saved 
                        preprocessing workflow graph. This allows to run confound correction without having 
                        available RABIES preprocessing folders, but the targetted datasink folders must follow the
                        structure of RABIES preprocessing.
                        (default: False)
                        
  --timeseries_interval TIMESERIES_INTERVAL
                        Before confound correction, can crop the timeseries within a specific interval.
                        e.g. '0,80' for timepoint 0 to 80.
                        (default: all)
